### Weather in Aurora station in NOAA (NOAA, n.d.)

* The nearest station of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is near Aurora, Illinois. This station records the maximum, minimum and various different temperature details daily and reports it back to NOAA every month. This Aurora NOAA station is around 17 miles away from the arboretum, so we assume that pretty much similar weather is being recorded in the arboretum. 
* This station also gives the precipitation for each day along with snow if any. Arboretum doesn’t record any weather data, but generally takes weather data from NOAA and the Daymet. The arboretum also has a R Programming function to pull data from Daymet into a CSV.  
* Some of the fields that you can find in a NOAA Record of River and Climatological Observations that can help us in our analysis are temperature minimums and maximums, precipitation and snow in inches along with a summary of what the day would look like. Out of these data, some even give information about if there was a extreme climate condition and what was it. 
* This would help us and arboretum better understand the climatic effects on Oak tress and how different species show subtle differences in the specific phenological phases. 
* Some other weather stations that are in and around arboretum are Morrison and Chicago Midway Airport. These are farther away from the arboretum than the station at Aurora

### What are the extreme conditions noted in the Morrison station 

Some of the extreme conditions that were noted in the Aurora station is mentioned in this section, also this section explains why it is important to know what extreme conditions the Oak Trees were exposed to in the two years (i.e 2017 & 18). I have listed only different kinds of extreme weather conditions to give a brief understanding of how weather is around the arboretum
*	There were flurries recorded on 01/06/2017 in the Aurora NOAA station along with Thunderstorms
*	There were several Thunderstorms recorded in Feb 2017 along with one snow storm.
*	The precipitation amounts only start to increase in May, but doesn’t have any extreme conditions which are notable after Feb 2017
*	There are thunderstorms here and they’re in every month through Nov 2017. 
*	In December there is a extreme condition of a snow storm and hail which might had a effect on the trees
*	As there is no Pheno phases in Jan and Feb, we are not so keen on the weather data, but in general their were a lot of snow storms and snow fall
*	The only extreme condition that was recorded in 2018 during the pheno phases is a Hail Storm on 08/02 with records saying around 3/4th inch hails falling which might have significantly offset the flower shedding progress
All these observations help us understand the extreme data entered during the pheno phases and also helps us understand the outliers of the data. 

### How Oak trees respond to extreme climatic conditions

Oak Trees are generally most resilient trees and only show little to no changes due to climatic changes. But as the climatic changes are increasing there are a lot of ouliers seen in the growth and other elements of a Oak tree. Some of them are really interesting and will help us in better understand some of the extreme data from our datasets about the phenological phases. 

Some of the changes due to weather are listed here.
*	Increased atmospheric CO2 increases water use efficiency because the higher partial pressure means a higher CO2:H2O exchange rate. It also means that nutrients become more limiting, thereby resulting in increased mycorrhizal activity. (Allen)
*	The NOx deposition results in a net fertilization of a site. This deposition reduces the root:leaf ratio and the relative amount of EM activity in some obligately EM plants. (Allen)
*	The winter temperature can be a big factor in the growth of oak trees especially the month of December and January or both. This may result from the respiratory loss of carbohydrate reserves at high temperature when the tree has no leaves. (Gray, 2016) 
*	High temperature is generally positive in the growing season although this effect seems to be shown more on one species (Gray, 2016)
*	The Northern species (found in the northern parts of the world) are adapted to the cold but will have to deal with higher overall temperatures over time. While some of the latter Southern species (found in the northern parts of the world) will probably be able to adapt to higher temperatures, the extremes in winter temperatures have taken a toll on these species. (Verweij, 2015)
*	Changes in climate have caused some serious issues throughout the country. The most glaring example of climate change causing extensive damage from pests is the Mountain Pine Beetle in the Rocky Mountains. (Verweij, 2015)
*	It is seen that the oak will find favourable conditions for its development in increasingly higher latitudes as time passes. (Fundazioa, 2011)
* At high temperatures, the decline in net photosynthesis is attributed to numerous processes including increased photorespiration, increased mitochondrial respiration, inactivation of Rubisco attributed to reduced activity of Rubisco activate, decreased activity of photosystem II (Robert Teskey, 2015) 
*	Maximum Respiration often occurs at temperatures greater than 50 °C, for example 52 to 57 °C in Eucalyptus pauciflora (species name) at different times of the year , ∼55 °C in Populus tremula (species name) and >45 °C in Picea mariana (species name). At temperatures above the maximum, R decreases rapidly, and severe cellular damage occurs at temperatures just above 60 °C (Robert Teskey, 2015)
*	The timing of the exposure is also critical. Excessive temperatures and heat waves are often considered summer phenomena, but during bud burst and leaf-out in the spring, considerably lower temperatures can cause substantial damage. (Robert Teskey, 2015)
*	Saplings had similar levels of leaf mortality and leaf scorch on surviving leaves, but produced very few new leaves (neo-formed leaves) after the heat event, indicating that there are ontogenetic differences in the capacity to recover from heat stress, perhaps related to stored carbohydrate availability. (Robert Teskey, 2015)
*	Families(Oak Trees) with superior height performance were the most sensitive to heat stress, compared with those families with intermediate or inferior rates of height growth. (Robert Teskey, 2015)

One of the great challenges for forestry is to select genotypes that are suitable for growth in the new climatic conditions that will be present in the 21st century. These future conditions include an increase in extreme heat events with increased frequency and duration of summer heat waves, increased fluctuations in temperature and an increase in monthly maximum temperatures throughout the year. Determining the selection traits that will improve productivity of managed stands in the future is an important unresolved question in tree breeding. Responses to temperature, drought, nutrients and CO2 may all be important in the novel climate of the future. Provenances from warmer areas usually have faster growth than those from cooler areas, so genotypic variation in response to temperature can be exploited to increase growth in managed tree species in the future warmer climate. (Robert Teskey, 2015)

### Where can we find data for weather near Morton Arboretum

Some of the Other sources where you can find weather data are -

* Daymet (NASA, n.d.)- which is a government website for Daily surface weather and Climatological summaries. It also has an archived data sets from 1900’s. It also has a good level of documentation of data recorded in Daymet.

* Data.gov (NOAA, Data.gov, n.d.) - this another government website for Daily temperature or weather records from a subset of stations in the Global Historical Climatological Network (GHCN)-Daily dataset.

* Ncdc-noaa (NOAA, NCDC-NOAA, n.d.)- is another government website. The daily records summarized here are compiled from a subset of stations in the Global Historical Climatological Network. A station is defined as the complete daily weather records at a particular location, having a unique identifier in the GHCN-Daily dataset.
